The result is approximately\na \"Clothoid\" or \"Euler spiral\".\n\n3. Gradients, up and down. Yes, we already have _Limit Gradients_ but you get this for free.\n\nOn a sequence of hairpins, you need to find an acceptable combination of minimum radius and\nlead-in to get the horizontal separation about right.\n\nOn a long track, the numerical technique used means the smoothed track can increasingly\ndeviate from the original track; you may prefer to work in sections.\n\nIt's also _really_ good at removing noise from IRL rides.\n",
