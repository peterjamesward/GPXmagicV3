# Welcome to GPXmagic

**GPXmagic V3 works best with Chrome** (by far)

## Quickstart

Begin with **Load GPX file** -- the white button on the top bar.

For many cases, especially if you have a recorded ride, you only need the blue **One-click Quick Fix** button!
(This appears at the top when you've loaded a file.)

If that doesn't work for you, there are many specialised tools to fix common issues. Each of these has
an explanatory video you can view by clicking the camera icon.

Click anywhere to dismiss this message. It will probably not appear again.

 Adjust the radius with the top slider and imagine you're "pushing" this circle into

Think of this as _Nudge_, supercharged. Use the markers to define a section of track,
then the circular 2-way drag control to move this section freely. There's a height adjustment
as well.

The real value of this tool is "Stretch" mode. Suppose you have a series of switchbacks
but they're too tightly packed for RGT Magic Roads. In stretch mode, you move a white marker
along the track between the Orange and Purple. Now, when you drag the 2-way control, the
white marker follows the drag and the track either side "stretches" to follow it.

With a bit of practice, you can add some separation to the switchbacks. It probably has
other uses as well, but this was the justification.

A track point, or a run of points, is slightly out of line from where you want it (them).
With Nudge, you can move a single point, or range of points, sideways and up or down.

What "sideways" means is a but subtle with bends. Nudge moves along what a carpenter would 
recognise as the mitre line, effectively half of the turn. **Be aware** than closely spaced
points nudged together can overlap on the inside of a bend. GPXmagic will not stop this.

the whole track.

1. Limit ascents and descents to set maxima. This will simply remove any gradients outside
the limits you set. This will affect the altitude for the rest of the course.

2. Replace the _altitude_ at each point with the average of a range of nearby points. Note that this
does not factor in the distance between points; it's a straight numerical average. It's basically
the "altitude box smoother" in another tool.

3. Replace the _gradient_ at each point with the numerical average gradient over nearby points.
Note that changing the gradient at even one point affects all subsequent points. This produces
quite pleasing results in many cases.

Here's a few options:

1. Add a spline to join the start and finish, completing a loop
2. Move the Start/Finish to somewhere else on the loop
3. If it's not a loop, add 60m before the start and 140m after the end for the RGT rider pens.

Sometimes you just want a straight to be straight and it's tedious to get rid of
all the wriggles. Sure, you could delete some of the points, but you might want to
keep some altitude changes.

Straightener is simple and single-minded. It takes all the points in the range and lines
them up. It will either retain their altitudes or impose a constant gradient. Note that
keeping the altitudes and squishing the points up increases gradients.

Smart smoother applies three constraints to the track:

1. A minimum turning radius - this applies to all turns but is most noticeable on hairpins which
will become circular arcs (rather like _Radiused Bends_)

2. How quickly you wish to enter and leave bends, because in real life you don't just
jerk on the handlebars, it takes time to lean into a bend. The result is approximately
a "Clothoid" or "Euler spiral".

3. Gradients, up and down. Yes, we already have _Limit Gradients_ but you get this for free.

On a sequence of hairpins, you need to find an acceptable combination of minimum radius and
lead-in to get the horizontal separation about right.

On a long track, the numerical technique used means the smoothed track can increasingly
deviate from the original track; you may prefer to work in sections.

It's also _really_ good at removing noise from IRL rides.
