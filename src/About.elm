# GPXmagic v3.2.13 (e575add3)

**GPXmagic V3 works best with Chrome** (by far)

* In case of problems the previous version 2.9.5 is [here](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/stepwiserefinement.co.uk/GPXmagic_2_9_5/index.html)

## In this update ...

* The v1 Gradient Smoother is back under Profile Smoothing - Apply uniform gradient. Use the slider
