# GPXmagic v3.3.2 (7d6cb084)

**GPXmagic V3 works best with Chrome** (by far)

* V3 is now the official release.
    The previous version 2.9.5 is [here](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/stepwiserefinement.co.uk/GPXmagic_2_9_5/index.html)

## In this update ...

* Sorry, I have had to temporarily remove the ability to read any embedded segment names in a GPX file.


## Acknowledgements
