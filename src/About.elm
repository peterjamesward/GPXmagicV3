# GPXmagic v3.3.15 (7dea493a)

**GPXmagic V3 works (by far) best with Chrome (and some derivatives)**

## Changes

* Route maker should be better at capturing the direction when a Road goes directly
from one Place back to the same Place. But please always check that the direction is
correct when you add it to a new route.

## Acknowledgements

* Thanks to all those who've provided support, comments, bug reports, and help along the way.

* Thanks to RGT for the Magic Roads concept and an excellent indoor cycling platform.

## Legal guff
