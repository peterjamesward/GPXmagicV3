# GPXmagic v3.2.0

(1cb9c37d)

## In this release ...

* **Smart smoother** could be the new go-to for quick smoothing of hairpins, removal of IRL noise,
reducing gradients and totally making things smoother. It's not unlike the gradient smoother in
_Smooth profile_ but it works for bends and gradients, and gives smooth transitions.

## Acknowledgements

* Special thanks to David Ogle for thorough testing, great bug reports, usability advice, and more.

* Thanks to John Bytheway for v3 ideas and support.

* Thanks to all those who've provided support, comments, bug reports, and help along the way.

* Thank to RGT for having the Magic Roads concept and an excellent indoor cycling platform.
