# GPXmagic v3.1.5

(5114807e)

## In this release ...

* You can choose to have land use data drawn "flat" or "sloped" which will attempt to drape
it over the terrain. When "sloped", it may obscure the road. It also makes Terrain work really hard
so will slow down the display updates. I have no intention of fixing either.
