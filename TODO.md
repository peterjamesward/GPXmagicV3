# BUGS

BUG: Classic bend smoother consumes all memory on certain looped routes where
     orange and purple are (possibly) co-linear, or something. (Samir bug)

BUG: Undo single point smooth at track start removes a point.

BUG: Map is not showing full detail after 1CQF, maybe, needs checking.
> Awaiting script from JB.

# WIP

Terrain as from v2 but with texture maybe

---

# BACKLOG

## Display 

Optionally show OSM land-use polygons on ground plane. (Not sure about Terrain.)

## 1CQF

Allow the use of markers for partial application.

## Route Builder

- Zoom on Route mouse-centred?
- Improve traversal direction display (with an arrow on each section?).
- Add "split edge at pointer" function, when editing an edge (?).
- Improve behaviour with IRL rides (use code from Intersections?)

## Usability

Drag Curve Former circle directly in Plan View.
Ditto for Move & Stretch, possibly Nudge.
Provide info text capability on top bar and on view panes.
Specific areas within tools as needed.

## Tools: old, updated, & new

- Can we auto-radius hairpins?
- Non-customisable keyboard alternatives for Load/Save/Undo/Redo/Fwd/Back/Purple (maybe 1-5 for views)
- Extract all text for translation (Muriel)
- Use localised number formatting everywhere (for French use of , and .)
- Ability to point-smooth transitions over a range
- "Tip of the day" tool? (Davie Ogle will write tips.)

## SVG profile rendering

Info on mouse move.
Scales?

## New smoothing

> This could be like a meta-box, or a "build your own 1CQF", in which
> we pipeline existing features, just like 1CQF.
> E.G. simplify > limit > interpolate > centroid.

## Loops

- Centroid average to work over S/F on loop
- Bezier smoothing to work over S/F on loop

## Texture for the ground plane, road surface

## Small stuff

Put all Font, Colour etc into a Palette/Style module for ease of change.

# Parked

## Offset/nudge logic

Just don't blindly mitre. For each pair of RoadSection, see if the points will
"overlap" and don't emit them all. May need some interpolation for altitude or whatever.
> Perhaps just try Bezier on interior turns.

## Map

DEBT: Map sends more click messages each time we click.
> They are debounced but, still, why??

## Laziness, optimisation

Don't render anything that's not visible.
