## The philosophy

> It's a track smoother, what's philosophy got to do with it?

Quite a bit, because it informed how I came to make GPXmagic the way at is, and maybe how to approach
it as a user.

It embodies a few key principles:

* **Visual** -- you get to see the track in three-dimensions so you can inspect it from any angle.  
This way you get the Plan view and the Rider view, as they are merely special cases.  
Profile view is different, because that's the route "unrolled" along its length.  
The Map view then became something of an add-on, and feels a bit "alien", but is essential for some tasks.


* **Interactive** -- unless it's impractical, you should see what effect a tool will have before you use it.
You should also be able to easily Undo and Redo changes.


* **Extensible** -- there's no one way to "fix" a GPX file; it depends on what you want to achieve.
GPXmagic provides a panoply of different tools, each of which it well-suited to addressing a particular
issue with a particular solution. 


* **Easy for most** -- that said, for many people (and I count myself in this camp), you just want to
take a GPX file and, with some confidence and little effort, transform it into a rideable Magic Road.

I think it's been fairly successful against these principles. Not without some bumps along the way, 
and some major course corrections with V2 and V3.
